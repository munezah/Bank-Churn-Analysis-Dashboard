## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Tracked  

This dashboard helps answer critical business questions such as:  

- **Churn Rate**  
  What percentage of customers have exited the bank.  

- **Churn by Gender & Age Group**  
  Which demographics are more likely to churn.  

- **Churn by Geography**  
  How customer attrition varies across different regions.  

- **Customer Satisfaction Analysis**  
  Average satisfaction scores by tenure and complaint status.  

- **Complaints vs Churn**  
  How customer complaints impact churn likelihood.  

- **High Value Customers**  
  Identifying and analyzing churn within profitable customer segments.

### 1. Data Preparation (SQL Developer)  
- Wrote **SQL queries** to add new columns and segment customers:  
  - `AgeGroup` ‚Üí Created age brackets (18‚Äì25, 26‚Äì35, etc.)  
  - `BalanceCategory` ‚Üí Classified customers as Zero, Low, Medium, High balance  
  - `TenureLevel` ‚Üí Grouped customers into New, Loyal, Long-Term  
  - `SatisfactionScoreLevel` ‚Üí Translated numeric scores into Low/Medium/High  
  - `IsHighValueCustomer` ‚Üí Flagged based on balance, products, and tenure  
- Cleaned and validated raw data before exporting to Excel.  

### 2. Data Cleaning (Excel)  
- Standardized categorical fields (Gender, Geography, Card Type).    
- Imported SQL-enhanced dataset for dashboard creation.  

### 3. Data Visualization (Excel)
